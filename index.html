        <h1>About</h1>
        This page is part of an unspoken initiative that many NIT H alumni keep taking from time to time to help their 
        juniors or college on a larger scale. It is really preposterous, and I've found so many people, juniors, 
        seniors, and batchmates alike having a tendency to not want to talk to anybody who aren't very 
        known to them. This gets ichy when it's time for those emails and phone calls to people lesser known and belonged:
        the potential recruiters. This animated web page is my and many others' personal view on the current placement system, 
        of NIT Hamirpur, namely a bunch of mere TPRs and a TPO. Now don't get me wrong here, I respect the time and effort they put in holding their responsibility, but it's not enough anymore because world is full of competition and there are so many students to take care of the placements of. I've met and talked to so many alumni since final year, and I find it shocking that so many of them will to mentor students, and even help in trying to get their companies visit Hamirpur, or, since in most cases that tends to be an issue, nearby, say Chandigarh. I find it more shocking, that some of the most reputed companies have visited campus in the previous times and recruited, primarily because, as I'm told by alumni:
        <ul>
          <li>They worked really hard for it</li>
          <li>Students were more serious and career oriented back then</li>
          <li>Being less number of people in a class and batch, they cared for each other more</li>
          <li>They not only limited themselves to campus placements but went forth and applied and got recruited off campus too.</li>
        </ul>
        My primary reason for doing all this is because:
        <ul>
          <li>I love my college</li>
          <li>I want people to realize that there is so much more to college than they experience</li>
          <li>That it's our responsibility to improve our placements not only for us and our batch, but also for the batches that are to come after us, since reputation of batch of one year in the companies that recruited them affects the desire of that company to recruit from the college again</li>
        </ul>

        Hence this is an urge, more to the current students of NIT Hamirpur, that they try to find out and talk to their alumni. And one of the primary reasons you would want to search them and talk to them would be when you'd be active in doing good projects, so you'd want to get guidance from people who have actually built things. You have no idea, many of our alumni are well established in startups, companies, and in some cases even stellar research organizations like ISRO and NASA. But not very less to alumni of the college also, who can keep taking more steps, as they always have tried to do, to make the current students aware of more things in the industries and the world that are happening. 

        One starting point is going to <a class="c-material-design" href="https://nith.almaconnect.com/contributions/sneak_peek" target="_blank">Alma Connect</a> and walk through the NITH Alumnus's linkedin profiles. I was surprised that alumni are constantly signing up there. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I've thought of a customized alumni web app (website which is a single page application), which would provide more features, more connectivity, less time and greater speeds between a student wanting to connect to alumni or vice versa. I'd love to hear your thoughts about it. Would such a platform benefit you, if we are able to get aboard students as well as alumni? Would you want to use it? If yes what services or features would you want it to provide you? If it's a good idea, and you are a web developer, can you suggest technology stack suggestions? (I've thought of Meteor Full Stack Framework). I urge you, that even if you have decided, at this point of time, to never open this web page again, neither think about the things that I requested of you, to reconsider and open your email client and think a bit about it. If you manage to garner some points, or would just want to provide feedback about this potential initiative, both good and bad points, please <a class="c-material-design"href="mailto:arihantverma1994@gmail.com?subject=Reply from The Bridge">Email Me</a>. 

        Thank you for your time, you are awesome!

        <h1>My Career Orientation In College</h1>
        I wouldn't say much, because 4 years experience is a long time to write about. I'll only cater to a specific genre of the experiences namely, career. In 6th standard, as many students, I'd envisioned myself clearing IIT-JEE. I didn't. I cried for 2 days straight, ate minimally (self pitying myself). I asked my dad, to fill the online preference of the branches randomly, I didn't know what branch meant what, which had scope in jobs or further direction of career. In short, I was a dull, uninspired person who wasn't helped substantially by anyone either. Days passed, I came to NIT Hamirpur. To put it in a summary, I was intimidated by the feats that
        <a class="c-material-design" href="http://sidgan.me/", target="_blank">Siddha</a>,
        <a class="c-material-design" href="http://pranavk.github.io/", target="_blank">Pranav</a>,
        <a class="c-material-design" href="http://vicarie.in/", target="_blank">Narendra</a>,
        <a class="c-material-design" href="https://abhgangwar.wordpress.com/", target="_blank">Abhinav</a>
        and many more achieved in their four years. I was terrified, petrified, stupefied and clueless about what I wanted to do, what was I intrigued about. When I ask myself this question, and I look back, physics and mathematics used to give me knowledge orgasms. They got lost in the race of something, which I didn't understand. And if there wasn't any race, I'd have lost myself with the help of lack of exposure. In retrospect I didn't do anything worth putting in my sincere resume. I was intrigued by many things, <a class="c-material-design" href="https://processing.org/", target="_blank">Processing Programming Language</a> being one of them. The problem with the sloppiness in the college is, you have ample amount of free time, and one tends to be swayed away and dominated by either playing, drinking, pointless internet surfing, tafring and in some cases porn. I was one of the persons who didn't put my attention towards any career oriented intentions, let alone any manifestation. I started studying for GRE, but then I realized, I didn't have any base to base it on and I wouldn't like to struggle from scratch, so I stopped it. I got a job, without any prior preparation (which I'm not proud of), but I joined, and that started my journey towards something useful(and yes, I started serious experimentation with the <a class="c-material-design" href="http://p5js.org/", target="_blank">Web Implementation of Processing Programming Language</a>). But alas! I would have had a career if someone would have put me in a direction, after having shown what kinda things lied in what direction. Because I want the 'now' students to be career oriented rather than job oriented right from the end of their second years. I made this, and that's that. If you have any questions, about this idea, about me, about college, or you have any experience to share related to the subject lines of this web page, about anything beside these things, or anything at all, feel free to <a class="c-material-design"href="mailto:arihantverma@gmail.com?subject=Reply from The Bridge">Email Me</a>.I'm a very good secret keeper.

        <h1>Excerpt From the Sentences Heard from Some Alumni</h1>
        A group of five 2015 batch passouts attended the 4th Bangalore Chapter Alumni Meet, and had some stark revelations.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Enter: <a class="c-material-design"href="https://www.facebook.com/manik.karol?ref=ts&fref=ts" target="_blank">Manik Karol</a>, CSE 2004 passout, has worked with Oracle, Intel, PayPal, and now works with Snapdeal. 
            <blockquote class="blockquote">“In our days, there used to be an educational academic trip for every branch. I went against teachers and even some of my classmates to persuade everybody to go to Bangalore to actually gain something out of it, instead of going to someplace which would only serve the ‘fun’ purposes”
            </blockquote>, he said.

            <blockquote class="blockquote">“I made everybody pay more, planned the whole trip, but it was worth the criticism and effort.</blockquote>

            On being asked by one of us why was that the placements weren't increasing in quality and quantity despite yearly efforts, and why 
            location is continuing to be a delimiting factor, he replied:

            <blockquote class="blockquote">"Do you think that you can just call an HR of a company at the niche point, and expect them to comply with your request to come to your college at that very instant, when the company would have invested a year in planning the schedules and the budgets of God knows how many colleges? This approach was, is and always will be faulty. The day when a second year guy would be as active in contacting companies for placements and internships as final year, then things would start changing. Never Before. I don't get it how current students can be happified by the limit of the highest package of college, that is significantly lower than almost every other NIT. We deserve more!"
            </blockquote>
            <br>
          </li>

          <li>
            Enter: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/InSearchOfDarkness?fref=ts" class="c-material-design">Kumar Ashutosh</a>, ECE 2007 passout, the then SRIJAN Editor, works with Microsoft. He called me up one night in the final year to ask about the placements in the college and said this:

            <blockquote class="blockquote">"This has to stop. The placement architecture of the college is not a scalable project. You can't expect to get companies on board simply by calling them or mailing them without prior contact. There should be a placement cell with for example 30 members, just like any other club, which works together tirelessly to get companies on board. Members should consist of students from all years, so that a first year should have contacts to build on instead of starting from scratch when he/she comes in final year."
            </blockquote>
            <br>
          </li>

          <li>
            Enter: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/tilakesh?ref=ts&fref=ts" class="c-material-design">Tilakesh Murthy</a>, MED 2006 passout, has worked with OTIS, Flowserve, and L&T, has been working with Ford for the past 4 and a half years in Supply Chain Management (SCM). He has been one of the most active alumnus of the college. In the Alumni meet this year, he said this:

            <blockquote class="blockquote">"As Alumni, we have a reponsibility to mentor our juniors, career wise, because we are more experienced and can help current students make career choices rather than job choices when they sit for placements. This is the problem. Current students pass out with a job, but they only are able to decide upon their career (what they want to do), after some months or years into the job."

              <br>
            </blockquote>
            A Fun Fact: Tilakesh started an initiative to collect contributions from Bangalore Alumni Chapter, from all those who wanted to contribute for one version of Hill'ffair (I don't remember which one), to successfully sponsor 40,000 Rupees
          </li>
          <br/>
          <br/>

          <li>
            Enter: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/anandrahul2886" class="c-material-design">Rahul Anand</a>, 2008, CSE Graduate, Currently Senior Technical Associate with Sapient. He read what this web page was all about then told us this:

            <blockquote class="blockquote">I have been a studious guy throughout my school. Once I came into college, our first point of interaction was with batch just one year senior to us. For almost the next 3 months, I kept hearing, not from one but from more than one seniors that grades & study won't do any good for you that you should enjoy your life.
              These were good suggestions also, very valuable, like you should focus up on extra curricular activities which is what is gonna help you in future & I completely agree with that. But through out my college years I never heard any senior tell me what to expect after college days are over. How can I be better prepared for that. How should I develop my skills for that, what things should I learn etc etc.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              You know, having a correct mentor can help you choose a direction where you can really achieve great things. I think this kind of knowledge every guy should be imparted with, once they enter the college, because most of them are very naive and new to things. Most of them are going to start living on their own for first time in their life away from their family.
